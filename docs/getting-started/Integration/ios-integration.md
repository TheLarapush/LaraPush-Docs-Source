# LaraPush iOS Push Notification Integration Guide

LaraPush provides a seamless way to integrate push notifications into your Progressive Web App (PWA), including support for iOS. This guide explains **both methods**: starting from scratch with a new PWA or integrating notifications into an existing one.

## ðŸ”§ Option 1: New PWA Setup

Use this method if your website is **not currently a PWA** and you want to configure both the PWA and push notifications at once.



### Step 1: Open iOS Integration in LaraPush

Log in to your LaraPush dashboard and navigate to:  
**Domain > iOS Integration**

From the available options, choose:

- **New PWA Setup**

This will guide you through setting up your app structure, manifest, icons, and iOS prompt configuration.




### Step 2: Fill Out Configuration Details

Youâ€™ll be asked to provide basic setup information:

- **PWA App Name**:  
  The name that will appear under the app icon when installed on iOS.

- **Start URL**:  
  The initial page users will land on when launching your PWA from the home screen.

- **Icon URL**:  
  A public link to your PWA icon. Recommended size: 512x512 pixels.

- **Prompt Text for iOS Users**:  
  A custom instruction shown in a popup to guide users through enabling push support:
  ```
  1. Tap below icon and "Add to Home Screen"
  2. Open the app from home screen
  3. Click on allow to get notified.
  ```

- **Reappear Time**:  
  Set how frequently (in seconds) this prompt should reappear if ignored.

Once youâ€™ve completed these fields, click **Save**.

### Step 3: Preview the iOS Prompt

After saving, the right panel will display a **real-time preview** of the iOS prompt. This simulates how it will appear on iPhones and helps ensure your message is clear and visually correct.

You can tweak and save again as needed.




### Step 4: Add Integration Code to Your Site

To activate the LaraPush prompt and service worker, you must add a code snippet into your websiteâ€™s `<head>` section.

This includes:

- Linking the manifest file
- Loading LaraPush script
- Initializing push notification configuration


(*Note: The full code will be auto-generated in your dashboard. No need to write it manually.*)



### Step 5: Download and Upload Required Files

LaraPush provides a ZIP file containing three key files needed to complete the PWA setup:

- `firebase-messaging-sw.js`
- `manifest.json`
- `icon512.png`

**Instructions**:

1. Download the ZIP from your LaraPush dashboard.
2. Extract the contents.
3. Upload these files to the **public root directory** of your website hosting server.




### Step 6: Save Configuration and Test

Once everything is added and uploaded, return to your dashboard and click **Save** once more to finalize setup.

Visit your website from an iOS device (Safari). You should now:

- See the popup prompt.
- Be able to follow the "Add to Home Screen" flow.
- Open the app and grant notification permissions.

Check the final confirmation box:
âœ… *"I confirm that PWA notification popup is visible in my application."*

## ðŸ”§ Option 2: Existing PWA Setup

Use this method if you already have a functional PWA and want to add **iOS push notification support** using LaraPush.



### Step 1: Select Existing PWA Setup

Go to **Domain > iOS Integration**  
Choose the second option:

- **Already Have PWA Setup**

This lets you skip PWA file setup and directly configure prompts and service worker connections.




### Step 2: Fill Prompt Details and Service Worker Path

Complete the form fields:

- **Service Worker File URL**:  
  Provide the existing path to your active service worker file (e.g., `/firebase-messaging-sw.js`)

- **Prompt Instructions**:  
  Help users understand how to enable push by adding to the home screen and granting permissions.

- **Reappear Time**:  
  Set how often (in seconds) the prompt should reappear if dismissed.

Click **Save** to proceed.

### Step 3: Add LaraPush Script to Your HTML

Insert the LaraPush embed code inside the `<head>` tag of your website.

This connects your domain to LaraPush and enables prompt logic.




### Step 4: Update Your Existing Service Worker

Open your existing service worker file and add the push config provided by LaraPush.

This connects your app to Firebase and LaraPushâ€™s backend, enabling delivery of push messages.


Make sure to use the exact details shown in your dashboard (project ID, keys, etc.).

### Step 5: Test and Confirm iOS Prompt

After saving everything:

- Visit your site in Safari (iOS)
- Add to home screen
- Open the installed app
- Allow notifications

Finally, return to LaraPush and check:  
âœ… *"I confirm that PWA notification popup is visible in my application."*
