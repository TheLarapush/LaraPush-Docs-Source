## How to Create New Campaign

1. **Creating New Camapaign**: To start, navigate to the **Campaigns** tab on sidebar and click on 'Create Campaign'. You can also do this directly from your dashboard.

2. **Launch URL** At this point, input the URL for the content you want to notify about. Click 'Fetch Content' to automatically gather the relevant information, like title and description, from the URL. This feature is a time-saver and ensures your notification matches the linked content. However, If you want more control over the notification content, you can manually enter the notification title, message, and image URL, giving you more flexibility to customize the notification as needed.

Using buttons in notifications can enhance user engagement and provide more options for user interaction. Here are a few use cases:

**Read More:** This button can direct readers straight to a new blog post or an important article. It's a straightforward way to increase traffic and engagement on your latest content.

**Share:** A 'Share' button can encourage readers to share your blog post on their social media platforms, increasing your content's reach.

**Subscribe:** If your blog has a subscription service, a 'Subscribe' button in your notification can be an effective way to increase your subscriber count.

**Download:** If you offer downloadable content, like an e-book or a podcast, a 'Download' button can lead readers directly to the download link.
