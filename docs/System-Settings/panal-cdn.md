# What is Panal CDN and Why It Is Important? 


When sending a notification, an image URL is required. If you don't use a CDN for your image URL, it creates additional requests to your server, which can slow down the process. Therefore, using a CDN is essential to enhance the notification sending experience.

## How To Use CDN?

Navigate to 'Settings', find the 'USE CDN' option, and turn it on than click on save.
