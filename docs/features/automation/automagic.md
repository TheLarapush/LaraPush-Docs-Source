# AutoMagic Push

AutoMagic Push in LaraPush is a feature that automates the process of sending push notifications. With this feature, you can select a random post from your recent posts and schedule push notifications to be sent at your desired frequency.

This means you don't have to manually select each post to send as a notification. Instead, the system automatically picks from your recent posts and sends notifications to your subscribers. This can save you time and ensure that your subscribers are regularly updated about your latest content.

## How to Create a AutoMagic Push? ##
 
Here are the steps to create an AutoMagic Push:

4. Set AutoPush Name and Select the timing for your notifications. We use the crontab format for scheduling because it provides flexibility and precision in setting up the timing.  We have provided a few examples for you. If you find them suitable, you can use them.
