# LaraPush - LP Links (Landing Page Links) Integration Guide

LaraPush's **LP Links** feature allows you to collect push notification subscribers from any landing page or URL you choose. This tool works similarly to the YouTube integration but is even more flexible. you can link any webpage, product page, video, article, or offer behind a subscription prompt.

---

## üéØ Use Case

**LP Links are ideal for:**

- Promoting external content (e.g., YouTube videos, blog posts, product pages)
- Collecting subscribers from platforms like Instagram, X (Twitter), or TikTok
- Creating redirect gates that enforce opt-in before allowing access
- Sharing short links that also build your push notification audience

---

## üöÄ How LP Links Work

When someone clicks your LP Link:

1. They see a permission prompt requesting push notification access.
2. If accepted, they are redirected to your **target link**.
3. If denied (and **Force Subscribe** is enabled), they are redirected again until they allow.

Each link includes full tracking for clicks and subscribers across devices.

### Step 3: Share the LP Link

Once created, LaraPush generates a custom short link like:

`https://demo.larapush.com/sl/XXXXX`

You can share this anywhere, such as:

- Instagram bio
- YouTube descriptions
- Twitter posts
- QR codes
- Emails or SMS

Whenever users open it, the prompt appears first, and if subscribed, they are redirected to the original link.

## üíª Full Page Script Integration (Advanced)

---

### Step 2: Add Script to Your Website
