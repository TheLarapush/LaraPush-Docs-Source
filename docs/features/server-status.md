# Server Status

The **Server Status** feature in LaraPush provides real-time information about the status of your server. This can include details such as server uptime, server load, memory usage, and other important metrics. This feature can help you monitor the health and performance of your server, identify potential issues before they become problems, and ensure that your push notification service is running smoothly.
