# LaraPush - YouTube Push Notification Integration Guide

LaraPush allows content creators and brands to collect push notification subscribers directly from their YouTube audience. This enables automatic notifications for new videos‚Äîsent directly to subscribers' devices even when they're not on YouTube.

---

## üéØ Use Case

**Who is this for?**  
YouTube creators who want to:

- Notify their followers the moment a new video goes live.
- Build a direct communication channel outside of YouTube.
- Increase repeat viewers and traffic with real-time alerts.

Instead of relying on YouTube's built-in notifications (which are often missed), LaraPush ensures your alerts are delivered reliably via the browser.

You will be taken to a form that asks for:

- **YouTube Channel URL**:  
  Enter the full URL of your channel in the format:

### Step 3: Get Your LaraPush Link

Once the channel is saved, LaraPush will generate a custom **LP Link** like:  
`https://demo.larapu.sh/yt/XXXXX`

This link is unique for your YouTube channel. It:

- Opens a branded prompt page with your channel‚Äôs identity.
- Automatically triggers the push notification subscription.
- Tracks subscriber counts across desktop and mobile.

You can now share this link in:

- Your video descriptions
- Community posts
- Social media bios
- Channel banner or pinned comment
