# LaraPush - Language & Region Settings Guide

LaraPush gives you full control over the localization of your notifications and timezone preferences. The **Language & Region** settings panel lets you customize how your system communicates with users based on language, time format, and regional context.

This guide walks you through each element shown in the **Settings > Language & Region** section.

## üåê Language Settings

### **Language**
This dropdown allows you to choose the system language used throughout the LaraPush admin panel.

- **Default**: English
- Additional language options may be available depending on your system configuration.
- You can click **"Change to English"** to switch back at any time if multiple languages are enabled.

Changing the language ensures that all interface elements (menus, tooltips, labels) display in your selected language.

## üïí Region Settings

### **Timezone**
This dropdown defines the default timezone for your LaraPush system.

- It affects how time-sensitive events like scheduled campaigns, backup timestamps, and reporting data are displayed.
- Choose the timezone that best matches your geographical location or the region of your target audience.

For example:
`(UTC+05:30) Asia/Kolkata`

This ensures accurate scheduling and consistent logs across all features in the dashboard.

## üîó Notification Localization

### **ReadMore Text**
This field allows you to customize the **"...Read More"** label that appears at the end of long notification messages.

- You can change it to something like:
  - "...Tap to Open"
  - "...Continue Reading"
  - "...Details"
- This text will appear as a clickable extension in the push message if the notification is truncated.

It helps enhance the click-through rate by providing a clear call to action for the user.
